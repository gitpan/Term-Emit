Revision history for Term-Emit

0.0.4  2012-09-12 19:14:13Z

        Added -showseverity option.

0.0.3  2010-06-17 22:02:14Z
        Bug 51923: Fix error in POD - patch submitted by FWIE

        emit_text() output is indented one level, by default.

        Fixed oops in _clean_opts():  We had iterated over the hash
          with each(), while changing the hash.  Shouldn't do this.
        Fixed test 50-fd-multi.t so it works on winderz.

0.0.2  2009-02-13 17:13:14Z
        Added test for -closetext

        The 'use' of Scope::Upper is order sensitive for keywords
          on some oses; swapped these keywords.

        Removed the 'syslog' export tag.  It's unlikely this would
          ever be used.

        Added emit_yes() and emit_no() convienence routines.

        Fixed dependency on Scope::Upper, I had 0.6 when it's 0.06;
          and a trailing space in the name string too.

        Modified emit_done to allow a zero return status.

        Shorted up some POD examples so they fit on a man-ified page.

0.0.1  2009-01-26 00:49:00Z
        Initial release.
