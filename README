Term-Emit version 0.0.4

The Term::Emit package is used to print balanced and nested messages
with a completion status.  These messages indent within eachother,
autocomplete on scope exit, are easily parsed, may be bulleted,
can be filtered, and even can show status in color.

This behaviour works across process boundaries.  For example,
if you have two scripts, one that calls the other (via qx(),
system(), etc.), the script's output will appear seamless as
the inner's messages will match the style and indentation
of the outer.

For example, you write code like this:

    use Term::Emit qw/:all/;
    emit "Reconfiguring the grappolator";
    do_whatchamacallit();
    do_something_else();

It begins by printing:

    Reconfiguring the grappolator...

Then it does "whatchamacallit" and "something else".  When these are complete
it adds the rest of the line: a bunch of dots and the [DONE].

    Reconfiguring the grappolator...................................... [DONE]

The do_whatchamacallit() and do_something_else() subroutines may also 'emit'
what they're doing, and indicate success or failure or whatever, so you
can get nice output like this:

    Reconfiguring the grappolator...
      Processing whatchamacallit....................................... [WARN]
      Fibulating something else...
        Fibulation phase one........................................... [OK]
        Fibulation phase two........................................... [ERROR]
        Wrapup of fibulation........................................... [OK]
    Reconfiguring the grappolator...................................... [DONE]
